# Global-Meat-Consumption By Country and Year
## Tableau Dashboard
## Summary:
I used both Tableau and Power BI to output visualizations based on Global meat consumptions of pork,poultry,sheep,and beef across several countries as well as BRICS, WLD(world), OECD(economic CO-operation and Development) and the EU27(European Union) across years 1990 - 2028
## Motivation:
Being an avid BBQ enthusiast and BBQ smoker, I was curious to see how the countries of the world consumed their meat and what trends if any are present. I feel like these visualizations could be useful to farms or meat industries for investment strategies.
